  This is the Laravel CMS framework project I developed from scracth during my intern. Many essential functionalities like CRUD, login in and out, password reset DB interaction seems working quite well at the moment, registraion and email function is not being added at current version as this system is intended for super adminstrator.Since env file can not be pushed to github, remember to import the sql file to your local DB to save some time setting up environment. (login dummies: admin & admin2 both with 123 as password)
  This project was developed and tested under wamp local host environment, might require further configuration if running on other environment. I assume quite some deficits existing as it is a one-man project developed over 3 weeks of time therefore more time might need to be committed for further optimization and I have left quite some blank area in the template for implementation in the future. 
  
Down below are some screenshot of the CMS system
